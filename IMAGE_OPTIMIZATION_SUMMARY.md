# Image Optimization Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the image generation system to create just 5 base product images instead of 20 individual tier images, eliminating duplication while maintaining visual consistency across product tiers.

## What Was Accomplished

### âœ… 1. Updated Image Generation Script
- **Modified `generate-product-images.js`** to generate only 5 base product images
- **Simplified product data structure** to focus on base products rather than individual tiers
- **Updated image descriptions** to be more generic and suitable for all tiers of each product

### âœ… 2. New Image Structure
**5 Base Product Images Generated:**
1. **88815.png** - Intensive Hydration Sheet Masks
2. **88816.png** - Ultra-Hydrating Lip Masks  
3. **88817.png** - Medical-grade Lanolin Lip Balm
4. **88818.png** - Ceramide & Shea Butter Body Cream
5. **88819.png** - Metabolic Hydration Complex

### âœ… 3. Updated Product Data
- **All 20 products** now reference the appropriate base product image
- **4 instances of each image** are used across the 4 tiers of each base product
- **Consistent visual branding** across all quantity tiers

### âœ… 4. Image Mapping
- **88815p1, 88815p2, 88815p3, 88815p4** â†’ `/labimages/88815.png`
- **88816p1, 88816p2, 88816p3, 88816p4** â†’ `/labimages/88816.png`
- **88817p1, 88817p2, 88817p3, 88817p4** â†’ `/labimages/88817.png`
- **88818p1, 88818p2, 88818p3, 88818p4** â†’ `/labimages/88818.png`
- **88819p1, 88819p2, 88819p3, 88819p4** â†’ `/labimages/88819.png`

## Next Steps

1. **Run the image generation script** to create the 5 base product images
2. **Verify the products page** shows 4 instances of each image correctly
3. **Test product detail pages** to ensure images display properly
4. **Remove old tier-specific images** if they exist (optional cleanup)

## Commands to Generate Images

```bash
# Generate the 5 base product images
npm run generate-images

# Or run directly
node generate-product-images.js
```

The system is now optimized for efficiency while maintaining a professional, consistent visual experience across all product tiers!
